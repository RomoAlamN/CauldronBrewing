# CauldronBrewing
Allows you to brew potions in a modded cauldron.

To create the cauldron, simply put a vanilla cauldron in a crafting bench, with blaze powder underneath it. 

All recipes are the same as in Vanilla. 

For Minecraft version 1.15.2, currently cannot backport to 1.14 because of an exception. :(

I created this mod for personal reasons, but please share any ideas if you want.
